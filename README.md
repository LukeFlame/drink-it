<h2 align="center">About 📖</h2>
   
   <p align="center">
      The Drink.it project, developed during <a href="https://rocketseat.com.br/">Rocketseat</a>'s Next Level Week, from the 22nd to the 26th of February, on the React trail, actually started as 'Move.it', focused on remembering those who use the computer too much, to make physical movements to avoid problems in the future.<br> Modified to 'Drink.it', which remembers every hour to hydrate or help others around you in hydration, with simple challenges, level progression and notifications. It mainly served me. 😊<br>
      <br>
      This event had a lot of exclusive and free content, it was just amazing! 😄
